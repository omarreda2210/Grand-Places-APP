# Grand-Places-APP
This is an experimental application to save locations and photos of historical places or the user's favorite places 
In the beginning, when there is no favorite place, the program tells you to add some places, and when you want to add a place, the program asks the user to write the name of the place, then add a picture and choose the location of the place on the map 
When you finish entering all these data, the program saves the data on the storage space of the mobile device 
Then the place is in a specific list where you can check out the place, its image and location
